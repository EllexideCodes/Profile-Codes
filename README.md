### Description

   These layouts are all property of Ellexide Codes. They are under copyright and should **not** be taken/copied/altered/redistributed/claimed/studied without permission from *Ellexide*. They will constantly be in progress for bug fixes or minor edits unless specifically stated.

   Some of these layouts are free to use as long as credit is given where credit it due. All editable versions of these codes can be found in the [Ellexide Codes Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/BappidyBoopidy).

### Warning

   Any attempt at copying, redistributing, remaking, major alterations, removing of credit whatsoever will result in you at risk of being sued--whether it be a commissioned code, requested code, or free code. If you wish to do any major alterations to your profile while still using a present base code, I am *always* available to do the alterations for you. 

   I will always warn users beforehand if I catch them taking any of my intellectual property. **But** I will not hesitate to take legal action if the user fights back.

### How To

#### How to Commission a Code
   Contact me on Discord or mail me on RPC with the following information:
   
   - Photo/s that you wish to use in the profile *(please specify which one you wish to have as the main picture)* 
     
   - Specify if you are an RPC Donator or not
   
   - Price range **IMPORTANT**
     
   - Reference *(optional)*
     
   - Face Claim name *(Example: If you are using L from Death Note, say "My FC is L from Death Note")*
     
   - Number of tabs
     
   - Theme *(optional)*
     
   - Character name
     
   - RPC username it will be used for

#### How to Request a Code
   Requested Code is different from a commissioned code. They are free and should there be some type of negotiation, exclusive for you to use. Otherwise, usual requested codes will become free for use.
   
   To request a code contact me on Discord *(and **ONLY** on Discord)*:
   
   - "I would like to request a code for this face claim..."
   
   - Link to photo/s you wish to use
   
   - Theme *(optional)*
   
   - Negotiation *(should you wish for exclusivity)*
      
   **NOTE:** Sending in a request does not mean immediate approval or acceptance. It all depends on how busy I will be, my muse, the length of my commission and waiting list.
   
#### How to Enter a Raffle
   Raffles happen every so often and is announced both on [The Blog](https://ellexide-codes.tumblr.com) and my [Ellexide Profile](https://roleplay.chat/profile.php?user=Ellexide). All requirements, however, will be posted on The Blog.
   
   I accept raffle entries 3 - 5 days after the announcement. The requirement varies constantly so if you weren't eligable or did not win the last raffle, stay tuned for the next one!
   
#### How to Report a Bug
   My codes are not perfect so every so often there may be a bug I may have missed. If you do find one, please find me on Discord or mail me on RPC with the following details:
   
   - Name of code *(Code Kitty Cat, Code Assassin, Code Ruby Eyes, etc.)*
   
   - Nature of bug or glitch *(if you can provide a screenshot or gif, please do)*
      
   **What do I get out of reporting a bug fix instead of fixing it myself?**
      Well, reporting a bug fix means that I will fix this bug for everyone who is or will be using the code. That makes me grateful c: If the bug you reported is considered a big enough problem, I will go ahead and make a free code with any of your characters as a muse and fits your specifications. (Not a requested code because this won't be exclusive, it will always be free)
